## What?

You might have came across a repo of mine named `hsg-tin-2020`. That was basically *"my roots"*: I started out as a "competitve programmer", mainly through the Excellent Student Context *(Kỳ thi Học Sinh Giỏi)* here where I live. The repo was basically all exercises I've done.

Now, it's the same thing. Except this time, it's 3 years later, and I'm in my final year of high school. 

oh, and, it's not district level anymore. We do be going straight to city level.

## Contents

Really much content here are what you would expect: practice exercies. 

I do plan to add my own notes here, but will consider it after the contest is done.
