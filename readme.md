## What?

You might have came across a repo of mine named `hsg-tin-2020`. That was basically *"my roots"*: I started out as a "competitve programmer", mainly through the Excellent Student Context (Kỳ thi Học Sinh Giỏi) here where I live. The repo was basically all exercises I've done.

Now, it's the same thing. Except this time, 3 years later, and I'm in my final year of high school. oh, and, it's not district level anymore. We do be going straight to city level.

## Contents

Really much content here are what you would expect: practice exercies. 

I do plan to add my own notes here, but will consider it after the contest is done.

Exercises are sorted as follows:
- `ifelse`: Set of conditional practice exercises 
-
